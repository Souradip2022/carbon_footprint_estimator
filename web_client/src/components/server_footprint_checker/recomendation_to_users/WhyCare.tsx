            The carbon emissions of a website can have a significant impact on the
            environment. In fact, the internet is responsible for approximately 3%
            of global carbon emissions, and this number is expected to continue
            rising.

          <p>
            By measuring and reducing the carbon footprint of your website, you
            can help to combat this trend and do your part to protect the planet.
            Every website has the potential to make a difference, and every little
            bit helps.
